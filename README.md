# Image Enhancer and Detector
This project is one of my machine learning and data-driven web apps made using Streamlit. The goal of this project is to built an image enhancer and detector app using PIL and OpenCV. View this app in action [here](https://img-enhancer-and-detector.herokuapp.com)

## Demo
Here are some demos on how to use the app,
